# Title: Monte Carlo Method for Baccarat (card game)
## Team Member(s):
Xiaoliang Jiang and Te Lin

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
(be sure to read the instructions given in course Moodle)
### Senario:
Baccarat is a popular card game played at casinos, especially among Asian gamblers.

Hands: the "player" and the "banker." 


Possible outcomes each round of play: "player" (player has the higher score), "banker" (banker has the higher score), and "tie."\n
Rules: After assigning the first four cards to player and banker (the order is player-banker-player-banker), If neither the player nor the banker is dealt a total of 8 or 9 in the first two cards (the single-digit of the sum of two cards on hand), the tableau of drawing rules is consulted, first for the player's rules, then the banker's. We will include this tableau later.

### Senario:
With Monte Carlo sampling method, we want to:

####   1.simulate the chance for each outcome;
####   2.consider in casinos, the bankers usually have unlimited funds, it will be interesting to simulate that with a certain amount of funds in player's hand, how long it will take for a player to lose all funds;
####   3.and based on different strategies a gambler has, we want to simulate the chance of winning accordingly.
 

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:


## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
